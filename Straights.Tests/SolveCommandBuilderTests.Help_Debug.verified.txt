                      []

Options:
  --mode <AnySolution|SimplifyOnly|UniqueSolution>  The solver mode to use.
                                                    SimplifyOnly:   reason about single rows and columns.

                                                    In AnySolution mode, the solver uses random numbers,
                                                    and results may vary from run to run.
