Straights.Solver is a pure dotnet library that solves, generates, and converts str8ts puzzles.

Straights.Solver theoretically supports grid sizes up to 64 x 64.
Generating large grids (greater than about 10 x 10) is computationally expensive and may take very long, however.

## Usage

### Generating a Grid
